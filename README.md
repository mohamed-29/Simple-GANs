# Simple-GANs
Generative adversarial networks simple project
GANs are generative models devised by Goodfellow et al. in 2014. In a GAN setup, two differentiable functions, represented by neural networks, are locked in a game. The two players (the generator and the discriminator) have different roles in this framework, as we will se below.

In this repository, I'm trying to generate hand-written digits as below. To do this, I had to learn what is a GAN and how it works.
